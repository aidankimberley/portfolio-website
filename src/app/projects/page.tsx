        `At the Harvard Biodesign Lab, designed, fabricated, and developed wearable ankle exoskeleton robots to assist gait. \
        Created detailed designs in SOLIDWORKS and fabricated multiple robot prototypes using SLS 3D printing, carbon fiber molding, \
        and soldering new electronic components. Conducted comprehensive data collection and analysis using MATLAB and Simulink, incorporating both on-body \
        and bench-top testing to optimize performance through power flow analysis and iterative design methods.`,

        The gearbox was required to withstand 60 HP at 5,500 RPM while transmitting power to a propeller at 835 RPM, meeting strict aerospace requirements \
        for weight, reliability, and safety factors. Applied AGMA and ASME standards to ensure all components exceeded the required 1.5 safety factor through \
        iterative optimization, stress analysis, fatigue life estimation, advanced material selection, and CAD modeling. Delivered a final design with manufacturing-ready CAD drawings for the complete gearbox assembly.`,
